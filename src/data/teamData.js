      description: `has a background in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics. He completed his Master's degree at Ramakrishna Mission Residential College.
        His research interests center on the design of battery materials, specifically examining their electronic and magnetic properties in strongly correlated systems.
        Rajdeep employs Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Machine Learning (ML) to explore these complex materials.
        In addition, he is developing machine-learning-based force fields to reduce the reliance on computationally expensive ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations.
        Rajdeep joined TCG Crest in 2023 as a Junior Research Fellow.`
